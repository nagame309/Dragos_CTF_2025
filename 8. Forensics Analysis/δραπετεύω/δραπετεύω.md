We found our HMI for the heating system with an open browser Window, making a lot of noise. Someone or something has opened this. http://nyan.cat does not seem to be malicious itself, our research at http://http.cat also shows nothing weird. We successfully captured a triage collection from the system.

Can you investigate what might be off with this browser? Can we identify if someone left a “calling card”?
